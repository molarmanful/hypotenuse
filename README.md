# hypotenuse
A CSS-only library for mathematical formatting. Meant as a proof-of-concept rather than a real alternative to existing math formatting libraries.

#Specs
The library mainly provides formatting not easily achievable through only Unicode and HTML formatting. It is extremely fast compared to other math formatting libs because it uses a small amount of HTML and CSS to render the necessary syntax.

The library uses DejaVu Sans Mono for wider Unicode support and more consistent spacing. All font units are expressed in `em`s for easy scaling.

# Usage
`hypot.css` contains the distribution code.
